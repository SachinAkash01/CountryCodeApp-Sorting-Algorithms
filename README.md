# CountryCodeApp-Sorting-Algorithms

## Description
An application to display country codes when a country name is given. This is a good example for the students who are looking to get a understanding about sorting algorithms such as Bubble sort, Selection sort, and Binary search.

## Application Logic
The ISO country codes are internationally recognized codes. Countries have two-letter combination (alpha 2) or a three-letter combination (alpha -3) and a numeric code (M49). two-letter suffixes are often used has domain names and three-letter codes used in events (sports and contests).

The application should also be able to display country code details in ascending order and in descending order.
<ol>
  <li>To sort in ascending order use Bubble Sort algorithm.</li>
  <li>To Sort in descending order use Selection Sort algorithm.</li>
  <li>To search use Binary Search algorithm.</li>
</ol>
